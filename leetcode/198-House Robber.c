/*
 * House Robber
 *
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house
 * has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from
 * robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and
 * it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into
 * on the same night.
 *
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each
 * house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting
 * the police.
