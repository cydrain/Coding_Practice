# The old song declares "Go ahead and hate your neighbor", and the residents
# of Onetinville have taken those words to heart. Every resident hates his
# next-door neighbors on both sides. Nobody is willing to live farther away
# from the town's well than his neighbors, so the town has been arranged in
# a big circle around the well. Unfortunately, the town's well is in disrepair
# and needs to be restored. You have been hired to collect donations for the
# Save Our Well fund.

# Each of the town's residents is willing to donate a certain amount, as
# specified in the int[] donations, which is listed in clockwise order around
# the well. However, nobody is willing to contribute to a fund to which his
# neighbor has also contributed. Next-door neighbors are always listed
# consecutively in donations, except that the first and last entries in donations
# are also for next-door neighbors. You must calculate and return the maximum
# amount of donations that can be collected.
